Model .pth file google drive link to download (since it is too large to upload to github): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paJA6mWLlPiAgFTn481G7bt96W1I1Sb3/view?usp=sharing

Example tutorial on Anaconda prompt:
1. Type in "cd" followed by a whitespace followed by a directory where .pth file, .py file, and image file is located in
2. Type "python AlgSolve.py {Image filepath} {.pth filepath}" make sure everything is seperated by whitespace
3. Results should appear in the prompt
4. Enjoy!
